# :crab: Advent of Code 2020 :crab:
A smaller version of grep written in Rust, build from accompanying knowledge provided in The Rust Programming Language.

## Usage
Every day I may structure the module differently, and I will put details below on how to run

| Day     | how to run |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| day_1 | this is a library crate, inside `day_1` use `cargo test` to run the test scenarios       |
| day_2 |  CLI based app that reads from file. inside `day_2` use `cargo run test1.txt` for pt1 and `V2=1 cargo run test2.txt` for pt2     |
